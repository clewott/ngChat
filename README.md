## Week 7 Project
This is an AngularJS app that I built with one partner.  This app is a chat app that allows users to chat like they were in a chat room. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at Christopher.R.Otten@gmail.com

### Local Deployment
Install Dependencies: `npm install` (there's a postinstall in `package.json` to get bower dependencies).

Install Mongo: 'brew install mongo' if on OSX or by other means.
Run Mongo Daemon: 'mongod' to start the local mongo database up
Run: `grunt` to run the default task.
